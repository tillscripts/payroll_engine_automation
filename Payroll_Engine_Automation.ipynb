        "\n",
        "### **1.0 The Problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "The existing payroll process relied on fragmented, manual Excel workflows. Data was siloed across multiple sheets (Attendance, Overtime, and Tax Master), leading to several critical pain points:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Formula Fragility:** Complex Excel formulas were prone to accidental breaks, leading to payment inaccuracies.\n",
        "* **Time Intensive:** Manual reconciliation of attendance and overtime records took several days per month.\n",
        "* **Compliance Risk:** Keeping up with changing tax brackets and pension deductions manually increased the risk of regulatory penalties.\n",
        "* **Scalability:** The manual process could not effectively handle a growing headcount without increasing administrative overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2.0 Method of Approach**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal was to build a \"Single Source of Truth\" using **Python** to sit on top of the existing Excel infrastructure. The approach focused on three pillars:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Centralization:** Using the `pandas` library to ingest and merge disparate Excel workbooks into a unified data frame.\n",
        "2. **Logic Encapsulation:** Moving tax laws, pension formulas, and bonus logic from Excel cells into version-controlled Python scripts.\n",
        "3. **Exception Handling:** Implementing validation checks to flag missing clock-in data or invalid employee IDs before any calculations occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3.0 Execution**\n",
        "\n",
        "The engine was built using a modular architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Ingestion Layer:** Automates the reading of Employee Master, Attendance, and Overtime sheets.\n",
        "* **The Calculation Engine:** A series of functions that apply logic for gross-to-net calculations, including tiered tax brackets and statutory deductions.\n",
        "* **The Validation Layer:** Logic to catch anomalies (e.g., negative overtime hours or missing tax IDs).\n",
        "* **The Output Layer:** Automatically generates individual, formatted PDF/Excel payslips and a master bank upload file.\n",
